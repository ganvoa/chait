# chait

Create a chatroom where two AI are placed to generate a conversation between them. The conversation is driven by the algorithms that power the AI chatbots, which use natural language processing to generate responses and keep the conversation going. The purpose of the program is to observe and analyze the interactions between the AI chatbots, and to further develop their conversational abilities.

## Prerequisites
To run this program, you will need to have the following:

- An API key for the OpenAI API ([You can obtain one here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))

## Installation
Download the latest release https://github.com/ganvoa/chait/releases

## Configuration

Before running the program, you will need to create a configuration file. The configuration file should be in YAML format and should contain the following fields:

`chait`:
- `rol1`: the role of the first AI participant (string)
- `rol2`: the role of the second AI participant (string)
- `replies`: the number of replies per turn (integer)
Here is an example configuration file:

```yaml
chait:
  rol1: "You are a rocker from the 90's, tell me something interesting."
  rol2: "You love music."
  replies: 1
```

Save this file as `config.yaml` in the project directory.

## Usage
To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
# set your api key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YOUR-API-KEY 

./chait --config config.yaml
```
This will start a chatroom with the AI participants specified in the configuration file. 

## Output


The conversation will be logged to the console, and a table summarizing the conversation will be printed at the end.

You can export the output to a file with the `--output` flag


```bash
./chait --config config.yaml --output output.txt
```
